# The NEH lab! (Node, Express, Handlebars)

DO NOT USE CLASS FILES FOR THIS PART -> USE DOCUMENTATION ON GITHUB

1. Use the Express Generator to create a new project in your Documents directory. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS IN THE TERMINAL WINDOW

2. Initialize a local repo using the Terminal / Git => create a .gitignore and add node_modules as well as .DS_Store.

3. add the new build - before you make any changes - and commit it (this will create a  master branch)

4. Create a new branch called yourinitials.dev.NEH -> this is where you'll make the view engine changes

5. Change the view / view engine setup in Express (app.js) to use Handlebars; create the views and structure that you need to make Handlebars work => YOU CAN USE THE EXPRESS-HANDLEBARS GITHUB DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS

STOP -> show me where you're at so that I can check it before you move on to the next part -> you should have a page loading with a data sent via your route and rendered on the page with Handlebars

YOU CAN USE CLASS FILES FOR THIS PART (6 to End)

6. Collect the database, the home page view, the video page view, the images, video and CSS from the Github Gists / FOL archives provided. Put them where they need to go in your project

7. Render the home view when you hit the main route; pass in the necessary data. You will need to do a SQL query on the main route to retrieve and render the content => set up your config and sqlConnect file(s) as required

8. Render the video view when you hit the video route (add that route in index.js) via a click from the main page (click on the video thumbnail to navigate to that page, passing in an ID via req.params so that you can do a query on the database)

9. Render the video and its associated information on the video page

10. Add and commit your changes to your local repo. DON'T PUSH TO GITHUB.

11. Upload a zipped copy of it to the FOL dropbox. DON'T INCLUDE THE VIDEOS - I already have them

12. Take a deep breath and pat yourself on the back. You did it!
